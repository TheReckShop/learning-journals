## HTML Lists

#### To make an unordered list use the < ul> < /ul> tags

- < li> < /li> is used to make items within a list that is then represented with a bullet
- much like this markdown note looks

#### To make an ordered list use < ol> </ ol>
- This makes all < li> items within the ordered lists have numbers and order assigned to them

- use < dd> < /dd> to set text within them as the definition
